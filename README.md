By Sheer Design is a vanilla-adjacent mod for the popular game Balatro. The main mission of the mod is to add content similar to base Balatro, but with a unique flair of it's own.

As of October 10th, 15 new Jokers and 1 new Deck are included in the mod. All should be unlocked by default.

Please note the early state of the mod. There will be several things that break or otherwise malfunction. As there is only 1 developer on the mod (me) who is not yet familiar with LUA, this is probably unavoidable at times. If anything breaks or otherwise fails to work in your playthrough, don't hesitate to contact me @blitzeyg on Discord.

Have a blast!
